# Central Claims about the Border Bill
- **Disguised Ukrainian Funding Bill**:
    - _"That bipartisan border bill was nothing of a bipartisan border bill. It was actually a bipartisan disguised Ukrainian funding bill—$60 billion in Aid to Ukraine, $15 billion in Aid to Israel in a bipartisan border bill."_
- **Designed to Be Rejected**:
    - _"That border bill was drafted to be rejected so that they could politicize the rejection by blaming it on Trump."_
- **Ratified the Crossing of 5,000 Illegal Immigrants per Day**:
    - _"That border bill would have ratified the crossing of up to 5,000 illegal immigrants a day, which if you do the math, is about 1.8 million in a year."_
- **Exclusive Jurisdiction to Washington D.C. Courts**:
    - _"Also gave DC exclusive jurisdiction, the DC courts of that corrupt DC hellhole, exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate on border disputes that would involve the states."_
- **Trump Opposed the Bill**:
    - _"They are playing the politics that they accuse Trump of playing... while blaming Donald Trump for doing exactly what they are doing themselves."_

    - **Power**: The Secretary may activate emergency authority if the **7-day average encounters exceed 4,000 per day**.

		- Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lZXcrIQ0VxOK_XLWAhZiSo0Pou-_hypTGzUFuEQtly0/edit?usp=sharing).
	- Limiting judicial review to the **U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia** centralizes legal challenges to a single court with expertise in handling complex federal issues, including immigration and executive actions. This concentration of jurisdiction can streamline cases related to national security, reduce forum shopping (where parties might seek favorable courts), and create consistent legal interpretations of the law. Additionally, DC courts are experienced in cases involving federal agencies, which may be important for cases challenging executive discretion in handling border security emergencies.
	- **Quote:** _“The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has sole and original jurisdiction over any challenge arising from the Secretary’s authority to exercise the border emergency authority.”

The border bill was not designed to be rejected. In fact, the author who was a Republican believed it would pass because he wrote it in the way that the republicans wanted it written. The reason why this bill had foreign aid attached was not democrats tacking it on, it was the exact opposite. It was a border bill tacked onto foreign aid and in hilarious fashion every one of those foreign aid provisions was [INCREASED](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-aid-israel-gaza-taiwan-c0645ad3f47f9d919c8988a98593e887) and then [independently passed](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-aid-israel-gaza-taiwan-c0645ad3f47f9d919c8988a98593e887) once this bill failed. Meaning the only part of the bill that failed, due to lack of republican support, was the BORDER AID. This bill would not "ratify" anything. Maybe Viva has trouble with translating to Russian (?), but the bill would make it so when encounters did get out-of-control the secretary MUST shut down the border. It makes it the law of the land that the Secretary of Homeland Security can at his discretion close the border when it is measurably going bad AND it gives the president complete discretion to close the border WHENEVER he deems it an emergency. In order to execute this power it also makes reporting of the border status a regular thing. This bill also bars access to the country from any alien who has been removed 2 or more times. Viva seems to imply that the exclusive jurisdiction part of the bill was changing existing law and moving it to a biased court in favor of democrats. Both of those are false and are part of a common pattern in Viva's deceptive coverage. So first, the jurisdiction was over the legal challenges to the NEW laws, policies, and powers outlined in the bill. This was not changing any existing jurisdiction. Second there are 7 republican appointed justices vs 9 democrat appointees in the DC district court and limiting jurisdiction is a way to keep costs down and streamline cases by targeting judges with more expertise in these kinds of legal questions. 
  
  So how could this border bill fail, due to missing republican support? I would expect every democrat to shoot this bill down when it is without the foreign aid, not in a million years would I expect the republicans to shoot it down. Viva was right about a single thing, it was shot down because of Trump. Trump called up some senators and told them to kill the bill and that he needed the border crisis for his campaign. Here is [TRUMP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gsR001be-U&ab_channel=MSNBC), saying that "*It made it much better for the other side*". [Mitt Romney](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2024/01/25/mitt-romney-trump-border-bill-negotiation-vpx.cnn) said Trump communicated with republican senators to kill the bill for his campaign. McConnell said "We all felt that the border was a disaster... and then our nominee for president didn't seem to want us to do anything at all..."
 
  Regardless of who killed this border bill, it was a gigantic step forward on controlling the border and while democrats might be to blame for the past few years of the border crisis, republicans are entirely to blame for any future consequences.
