+ November 7, 2000  
+ Election Day  
+ The U.S. presidential election between Al Gore and George W. Bush takes place. Results are too close to call in several key states, with Florida becoming the pivotal battleground. Early projections for Gore are later retracted as the vote count fluctuates. By the end of the night, the margin in Florida is within a few hundred votes.

+ November 8, 2000  
+ Florida's Automatic Recount  
+ With Bush leading by 1,784 votes, Florida law triggers an automatic machine recount due to the closeness of the results. This recount reduces Bush’s lead to just 327 votes, prompting additional legal and manual recount efforts in several Democratic-leaning counties.

+ November 9, 2000  
+ Gore's Legal Team Requests Manual Recounts  
+ Al Gore’s campaign requests manual recounts in four key Florida counties: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Volusia. Legal disputes arise over how to conduct these recounts and the validity of certain ballots, including the infamous "hanging chads" on punch-card ballots.

+ November 11-12, 2000  
+ Palm Beach Ballot Confusion  
+ Voters in Palm Beach County report confusion over the "butterfly ballot" design, which may have caused thousands of votes for Gore to be miscast for third-party candidate Pat Buchanan. This issue is added to the legal challenges surrounding the recount process.

+ November 14, 2000  
+ Florida Secretary of State Deadline  
+ Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris announces that counties must submit final vote totals by November 14. Gore's team challenges this deadline in court, seeking more time to complete manual recounts in selected counties.

+ November 17, 2000  
+ Florida Supreme Court Allows Extended Recount  
+ The Florida Supreme Court rules in favor of extending the deadline for manual recounts until November 26, 2000. The decision further complicates the ongoing legal battles between the two campaigns.

+ November 26, 2000  
+ Bush Declared Winner by Florida Certification  
+ Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris certifies Bush as the winner of Florida by 537 votes, giving him the state's 25 electoral votes. Gore's team immediately files a lawsuit contesting the certification, arguing that not all votes were properly counted.

+ December 1, 2000  
+ U.S. Supreme Court Agrees to Hear *Bush v. Gore*  
+ The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to take up the case after Bush’s team appeals the Florida Supreme Court's ruling to allow further recounts. The case centers on whether the recount process violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.

+ Recounts Halted by Supreme Court  
+ The U.S. Supreme Court issues a 5-4 decision to halt the manual recounts in Florida, citing concerns about equal protection and inconsistent recount standards across different counties. 

+ December 12, 2000  
+ Supreme Court's Final Ruling  
+ The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, rules that the Florida recount must stop. The Court holds that no constitutional way could be found to complete the recount by the federal deadline (December 12), effectively handing the presidency to Bush. The decision rests on the argument that different methods of counting ballots in different counties violated the Equal Protection Clause.
