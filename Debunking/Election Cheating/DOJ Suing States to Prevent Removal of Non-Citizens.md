https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1371386/dl - DOJ lawsuit

"This case is about Section 8(c)(2) of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), also known as the Quiet Period Provision, which requires states to complete systematic programs intended to remove the names of ineligible voters from registration lists by no later than 90 days before federal elections. 52 U.S.C. ยง 20507(c)(2)."

"Therefore, at least 717 individuals targeted by the Program have so far confirmed that they are in fact U.S. citizens."

If the claim of 717 is true, not only did the state obviously break the law they did so in a way that removed American citizens from voter registration rolls.
