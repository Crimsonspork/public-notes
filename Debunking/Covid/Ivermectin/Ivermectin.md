## Effects of a Single Dose of Ivermectin on Viral and Clinical Outcomes in Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infected Subjects: A Pilot Clinical Trial in Lebanon

_"Inferential statistical analysis shows that subjects in the ivermectin group developed less symptoms of fever (2% vs. 22%), anosmia (6% vs. 32%), myalgia (0% vs. 18%), and loss of taste (6% vs. 24%) in comparison with the control group (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, p = 0.002, and p = 0.012, respectively). In addition, three (6%) patients receiving standard treatment in the control group needed hospitalization throughout the process, while none of the patients receiving ivermectin needed to be hospitalized (_p_ = 0.079)."

_"This strongly indicates an increase (~ double) in the Ct-value in the experimental group. This leads to a ~2200-fold difference between the ivermectin and control groups at 72 h"_
