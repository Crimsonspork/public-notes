**Overview:**

- **Location:** Trump Tower, New York City
- **Key Participants:**
    - **Donald Trump Jr.**: Eldest son of then-candidate Donald Trump and a top executive in the Trump Organization. He was actively involved in his father's presidential campaign.
    - **Paul Manafort**: Trump’s campaign chairman at the time. Manafort was a seasoned political consultant with extensive experience, including controversial ties to pro-Russian figures in Ukraine.
    - **Jared Kushner**: Senior advisor to Donald Trump’s campaign and Trump’s son-in-law. Kushner played a key role in managing campaign strategy and communications.
    - **Natalia Veselnitskaya**: A Russian lawyer with connections to the Kremlin. She was known for lobbying against the Magnitsky Act, a U.S. law imposing sanctions on Russian officials involved in human rights abuses.
    - **Rob Goldstone**: A British publicist who facilitated the meeting, claiming that the Russian government was offering incriminating information on Hillary Clinton as part of their support for Trump.

**Background and Purpose of the Meeting:**

- The meeting was set up after Rob Goldstone contacted Donald Trump Jr., offering “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary Clinton.” Goldstone described the offer as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”
- Eager to receive damaging information on Clinton, Trump Jr. responded enthusiastically, saying, “If it’s what you say, I love it.” This exchange raised concerns about the Trump campaign’s willingness to accept help from a foreign government.

**What Happened During the Meeting:**

- During the meeting, Veselnitskaya initially talked about the Magnitsky Act and its impact on Russian adoptions by U.S. citizens. The Magnitsky Act had led to Russian retaliation, including banning U.S. adoptions of Russian children.
- Trump Jr. and other attendees quickly realized that Veselnitskaya did not have the promised damaging information on Clinton. The discussion about adoptions was seen as a pretext, and the meeting ended without the expected information exchange.

**Controversy and Misleading Statements:**

- The meeting gained widespread attention when it was revealed in July 2017, leading to intense scrutiny of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
- In response to media inquiries, President Trump personally dictated a statement for Donald Trump Jr. that falsely described the meeting as being "primarily about Russian adoptions," downplaying its original intent to gather dirt on Clinton.
