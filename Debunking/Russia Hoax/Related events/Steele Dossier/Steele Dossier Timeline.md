+ June 2016
+ Christopher Steele Hired
+ Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer, was hired by **Fusion GPS**, a private research firm, to investigate Donald Trump’s ties to Russia. Fusion GPS was originally hired by a conservative media outlet during the Republican primaries but later worked for the **Democratic National Committee (DNC)** and **Hillary Clinton's campaign** after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.

+ June - December 2016
+ Steele's Research and Dossier Compilation
+ Over several months, Steele gathered intelligence from sources connected to Russia, compiling a series of memos that would later be known as the **Steele Dossier**. The dossier alleged that the Russian government had compromising material on Donald Trump (referred to as “kompromat”) and had been cultivating Trump for several years. It also made claims about potential collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.

+ October 2016
+ Dossier Shared with the FBI
+ Steele shared the information he had collected with the **FBI**, concerned about the national security implications of his findings. This information would later form part of the basis for the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

+ October 21, 2016
+ FISA Warrant on Carter Page
+ The FBI used some of the information from the Steele Dossier, along with other evidence, to obtain a **FISA warrant** to surveil **Carter Page**, a former Trump campaign advisor. The dossier was not the only evidence used to justify the surveillance, but it was cited in the FISA application.

+ January 10, 2017
+ Steele Dossier Publicly Released
+ BuzzFeed News published the Steele Dossier in full, sparking intense controversy. Many of the dossier's allegations had not been corroborated, but it detailed explosive claims about Trump's potential ties to Russia, including the infamous and unverified “**pee tape**” allegation. The dossier also included allegations of secret meetings between Trump campaign officials and Russian operatives.

+ Early 2017
+ FBI Investigation and Verification Efforts
+ After the release of the dossier, the **FBI** continued to investigate its claims, though much of the dossier remained unverified. The dossier’s role in the FBI’s investigation became a point of contention, as critics of the investigation accused the FBI of relying too heavily on Steele’s unverified findings.

+ April 2017
+ Steele Dossier Mentioned in Congressional Testimonies
+ The Steele Dossier became a focus of several congressional investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. **James Comey**, then-FBI Director, testified that the FBI was working to corroborate the allegations in the dossier but noted that parts of it remained unverified.

+ December 2017
+ Origins of the Dossier Come to Light
+ It was revealed that the Steele Dossier was funded by the DNC and the **Clinton campaign**, raising questions about its political motivations. Critics of the investigation into Russian interference, particularly Trump and his allies, argued that the dossier was part of a politically motivated effort to undermine Trump’s presidency.

+ 2018
+ The Nunes Memo Controversy
+ In February 2018, **Devin Nunes**, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, released a memo alleging that the FBI had abused its surveillance powers in obtaining the FISA warrant against Carter Page, relying too heavily on the Steele Dossier. This sparked a broader debate about the FBI’s use of the dossier and the legitimacy of the investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia.

+ December 9, 2019
+ DOJ Inspector General Report Released
+ The **Department of Justice Inspector General**, Michael Horowitz, released a report on the FBI’s handling of the FISA warrant process and its use of the Steele Dossier. The report found that the FBI did use the dossier in its FISA applications, but it criticized the FBI for failing to verify the information before using it. The report also found that while the dossier was a factor, it was not the sole basis for the investigation into Russian interference.

+ October 2020
+ Christopher Steele Defends Dossier
+ In an interview, Steele defended his work, stating that while some of the details in the dossier remained unverified, other parts had been corroborated. He maintained that the dossier was a legitimate intelligence-gathering effort, not a politically motivated hit job.

+ April 2021
+ FBI Discredits Some Parts of the Dossier
+ Further investigation into the dossier revealed that some of its most sensational claims, including the alleged **“pee tape”** incident, were not substantiated and that some of the sources used by Steele were unreliable. This led to ongoing debates about the credibility of the dossier and its role in the FBI’s investigation.

+ November 2021
+ Steele Dossier Source Indicted
+ **Igor Danchenko**, a key source for the Steele Dossier, was indicted for lying to the FBI about his sources of information. The indictment raised further doubts about the credibility of the dossier and its allegations against Trump.
